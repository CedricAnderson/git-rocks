        <h5>Create, list, delete or verify a tag object signed with GPG.</h5>
        <p><b>USAGE</b></p>
        <pre>
git tag [-a | -s | -u &lt;key-id&gt;] [-f] [-m &lt;msg&gt; | -F &lt;file&gt;]
        &lt;tagname&gt; [&lt;commit&gt; | &lt;object&gt;]

git tag [-n[&lt;num&gt;]] -l [--contains &lt;commit&gt;] [--points-at &lt;object&gt;]
        [--column[=&lt;options&gt;] | --no-column] [&lt;pattern&gt;...]
        [&lt;pattern&gt;...]
git tag -v &lt;tagname&gt;...
        </pre>
        <p><b>DESCRIPTION</b></p>
        <p>
        Add a tag reference in refs/tags/, unless -d/-l/-v is given to delete, list or verify tags.
        <br><br>
        Unless -f is given, the named tag must not yet exist.
        <br><br>
        If one of -a, -s, or -u &lt;key-id&gt; is passed, the command creates a tag object, and requires a tag
        message. Unless -m &lt;msg&gt; or -F &lt;file&gt; is given, an editor is started for the user to type in the tag
        message.
        <br><br>
        If -m &lt;msg&gt; or -F &lt;file&gt; is given and -a, -s, and -u &lt;key-id&gt; are absent, -a is implied.
        <br><br>
        Otherwise just a tag reference for the SHA-1 object name of the commit object is created (i.e. a
        lightweight tag).
        <br><br>
        A GnuPG signed tag object will be created when -s or -u &lt;key-id&gt; is used. When -u &lt;key-id&gt; is not
        used, the committer identity for the current user is used to find the GnuPG key for signing. The
        configuration variable gpg.program is used to specify custom GnuPG binary.
        <br><br>
        Tag objects (created with -a, -s, or -u) are called "annotated" tags; they contain a creation date,
        the tagger name and e-mail, a tagging message, and an optional GnuPG signature. Whereas a
        "lightweight" tag is simply a name for an object (usually a commit object).
        <br><br>
        Annotated tags are meant for release while lightweight tags are meant for private or temporary
        object labels. For this reason, some git commands for naming objects (like git describe) will ignore
        lightweight tags by default.
        </p>
        <p><b>OPTIONS</b></p>
        <pre>
   -a, --annotate
       Make an unsigned, annotated tag object

   -s, --sign
       Make a GPG-signed tag, using the default e-mail address's key.

   -u &lt;key-id&gt;, --local-user=&lt;key-id&gt;
       Make a GPG-signed tag, using the given key.

   -f, --force
       Replace an existing tag with the given name (instead of failing)

   -d, --delete
       Delete existing tags with the given names.

   -v, --verify
       Verify the gpg signature of the given tag names.

   -n&lt;num&gt;
       &lt;num&gt; specifies how many lines from the annotation, if any, are printed when using -l. The
       default is not to print any annotation lines. If no number is given to -n, only the first line
       is printed. If the tag is not annotated, the commit message is displayed instead.

   -l &lt;pattern&gt;, --list &lt;pattern&gt;
       List tags with names that match the given pattern (or all if no pattern is given). Running "git
       tag" without arguments also lists all tags. The pattern is a shell wildcard (i.e., matched using
       fnmatch(3)). Multiple patterns may be given; if any of them matches, the tag is shown.

   --sort=&lt;type&gt;
       Sort in a specific order. Supported type is "refname" (lexicographic order), "version:refname"
       or "v:refname" (tag names are treated as versions). Prepend "-" to reverse sort order. When this
       option is not given, the sort order defaults to the value configured for the tag.sort variable
       if it exists, or lexicographic order otherwise. See git-config(1).

   --column[=&lt;options&gt;], --no-column
       Display tag listing in columns. See configuration variable column.tag for option syntax.--column
       and --no-column without options are equivalent to always and never respectively.

       This option is only applicable when listing tags without annotation lines.

   --contains [&lt;commit&gt;]
       Only list tags which contain the specified commit (HEAD if not specified).

   --points-at &lt;object&gt;
       Only list tags of the given object.

   -m &lt;msg&gt;, --message=&lt;msg&gt;
       Use the given tag message (instead of prompting). If multiple -m options are given, their values
       are concatenated as separate paragraphs. Implies -a if none of -a, -s, or -u &lt;key-id&gt; is given.

   -F &lt;file&gt;, --file=&lt;file&gt;
       Take the tag message from the given file. Use - to read the message from the standard input.
       Implies -a if none of -a, -s, or -u &lt;key-id&gt; is given.

   --cleanup=&lt;mode&gt;
       This option sets how the tag message is cleaned up. The &lt;mode&gt; can be one of verbatim,
       whitespace and strip. The strip mode is default. The verbatim mode does not change message at
       all, whitespace removes just leading/trailing whitespace lines and strip removes both whitespace
       and commentary.

   &lt;tagname&gt;
       The name of the tag to create, delete, or describe. The new tag name must pass all checks
       defined by git-check-ref-format(1). Some of these checks may restrict the characters allowed in
       a tag name.

   &lt;commit&gt;, &lt;object&gt;
       The object that the new tag will refer to, usually a commit. Defaults to HEAD.

        <h5>Apply the changes introduced by some existing commits.</h5>
        <p><b>USAGE</b></p>
        <pre>
git cherry-pick [--edit] [-n] [-m parent-number] [-s] [-x] [--ff]
                [-S[&lt;key-id&gt;]] &lt;commit&gt;...
git cherry-pick --continue
git cherry-pick --quit
git cherry-pick --abort
        </pre>
        <p><b>DESCRIPTION</b></p>
        <p>
        Given one or more existing commits, apply the change each one introduces, recording a new commit for
        each. This requires your working tree to be clean (no modifications from the HEAD commit).
        <br><br>
        When it is not obvious how to apply a change, the following happens:
        <ol>
        <li>The current branch and HEAD pointer stay at the last commit successfully made.</li>
        <li>The CHERRY_PICK_HEAD ref is set to point at the commit that introduced the change that is difficult to apply.</li>
        <li>Paths in which the change applied cleanly are updated both in the index file and in your working tree.</li>
        <li>For conflicting paths, the index file records up to three versions, as described in the "TRUE MERGE" section of git-merge(1). The working tree files will include a description of the conflict bracketed by the usual conflict markers &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.</li>
        <li>No other modifications are made.</li>
        </ol>
        See git-merge(1) for some hints on resolving such conflicts.
        </p>
        <p><b>OPTIONS</b></p>
        <pre>
   &lt;commit&gt;...
       Commits to cherry-pick. For a more complete list of ways to spell commits, see gitrevisions(7).
       Sets of commits can be passed but no traversal is done by default, as if the --no-walk option
       was specified, see git-rev-list(1). Note that specifying a range will feed all &lt;commit&gt;...
       arguments to a single revision walk (see a later example that uses maint master..next).

   -e, --edit
       With this option, git cherry-pick will let you edit the commit message prior to committing.

   -x
       When recording the commit, append a line that says "(cherry picked from commit ...)" to the
       original commit message in order to indicate which commit this change was cherry-picked from.
       This is done only for cherry picks without conflicts. Do not use this option if you are
       cherry-picking from your private branch because the information is useless to the recipient. If
       on the other hand you are cherry-picking between two publicly visible branches (e.g. backporting
       a fix to a maintenance branch for an older release from a development branch), adding this
       information can be useful.

   -r
       It used to be that the command defaulted to do -x described above, and -r was to disable it. Now
       the default is not to do -x so this option is a no-op.

   -m parent-number, --mainline parent-number
       Usually you cannot cherry-pick a merge because you do not know which side of the merge should be
       considered the mainline. This option specifies the parent number (starting from 1) of the
       mainline and allows cherry-pick to replay the change relative to the specified parent.

   -n, --no-commit
       Usually the command automatically creates a sequence of commits. This flag applies the changes
       necessary to cherry-pick each named commit to your working tree and the index, without making
       any commit. In addition, when this option is used, your index does not have to match the HEAD
       commit. The cherry-pick is done against the beginning state of your index.

       This is useful when cherry-picking more than one commits' effect to your index in a row.

   -s, --signoff
       Add Signed-off-by line at the end of the commit message.

   -S[&lt;key-id&gt;], --gpg-sign[=&lt;key-id&gt;]
       GPG-sign commits.

   --ff
       If the current HEAD is the same as the parent of the cherry-pick'ed commit, then a fast forward
       to this commit will be performed.

   --allow-empty
       By default, cherry-picking an empty commit will fail, indicating that an explicit invocation of
       git commit --allow-empty is required. This option overrides that behavior, allowing empty
       commits to be preserved automatically in a cherry-pick. Note that when "--ff" is in effect,
       empty commits that meet the "fast-forward" requirement will be kept even without this option.
       Note also, that use of this option only keeps commits that were initially empty (i.e. the commit
       recorded the same tree as its parent). Commits which are made empty due to a previous commit are
       dropped. To force the inclusion of those commits use --keep-redundant-commits.

   --allow-empty-message
       By default, cherry-picking a commit with an empty message will fail. This option overrides that
       behaviour, allowing commits with empty messages to be cherry picked.

   --keep-redundant-commits
       If a commit being cherry picked duplicates a commit already in the current history, it will
       become empty. By default these redundant commits are ignored. This option overrides that
       behavior and creates an empty commit object. Implies --allow-empty.

   --strategy=&lt;strategy&gt;
       Use the given merge strategy. Should only be used once. See the MERGE STRATEGIES section in git-
       merge(1) for details.

   -X&lt;option&gt;, --strategy-option=&lt;option&gt;
       Pass the merge strategy-specific option through to the merge strategy. See git-merge(1) for
       details.
