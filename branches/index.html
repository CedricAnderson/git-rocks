           [--list] [-v [--abbrev=&lt;length&gt; | --no-abbrev]]

        </pre>
        <p><b>DESCRIPTION</b></p>
        <p>
        If --list is given, or if there are no non-option arguments, existing branches are listed; the current
        branch will be highlighted with an asterisk. Option -r causes the remote-tracking branches to be
        listed, and option -a shows both local and remote branches. If a &lt;pattern&gt; is given, it is used as a
        shell wildcard to restrict the output to matching branches. If multiple patterns are given, a branch is
        shown if it matches any of the patterns. Note that when providing a &lt;pattern&gt;, you must use --list;
        otherwise the command is interpreted as branch creation.
        <br><br>
        With --contains, shows only the branches that contain the named commit (in other words, the branches
        whose tip commits are descendants of the named commit). With --merged, only branches merged into the
        named commit (i.e. the branches whose tip commits are reachable from the named commit) will be listed.
        With --no-merged only branches not merged into the named commit will be listed. If the &lt;commit&gt;
        argument is missing it defaults to HEAD (i.e. the tip of the current branch).
        <br><br>
        The command's second form creates a new branch head named &lt;branchname&gt; which points to the current
        HEAD, or &lt;start-point&gt; if given.
        <br><br>
        Note that this will create the new branch, but it will not switch the working tree to it; use "git
        checkout &lt;newbranch&gt;" to switch to the new branch.
        <br><br>
        When a local branch is started off a remote-tracking branch, Git sets up the branch (specifically the
        branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote and branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge configuration entries) so that git pull will appropriately
        merge from the remote-tracking branch. This behavior may be changed via the global
        branch.autosetupmerge configuration flag. That setting can be overridden by using the --track and
        --no-track options, and changed later using git branch --set-upstream-to.
        <br><br>
        With a -m or -M option, &lt;oldbranch&gt; will be renamed to &lt;newbranch&gt;. If &lt;oldbranch&gt; had a corresponding
        reflog, it is renamed to match &lt;newbranch&gt;, and a reflog entry is created to remember the branch
        renaming. If &lt;newbranch&gt; exists, -M must be used to force the rename to happen.
        <br><br>
        With a -d or -D option, &lt;branchname&gt; will be deleted. You may specify more than one branch for
        deletion. If the branch currently has a reflog then the reflog will also be deleted.
        <br><br>
        Use -r together with -d to delete remote-tracking branches. Note, that it only makes sense to delete
        remote-tracking branches if they no longer exist in the remote repository or if git fetch was
        configured not to fetch them again. See also the prune subcommand of git-remote(1) for a way to clean
        up all obsolete remote-tracking branches.
        </p>
        <p><b>OPTIONS</b></p>
        <pre>
   -d, --delete
       Delete a branch. The branch must be fully merged in its upstream branch, or in HEAD if no upstream
       was set with --track or --set-upstream.

   -D
       Delete a branch irrespective of its merged status.

   -l, --create-reflog
       Create the branch's reflog. This activates recording of all changes made to the branch ref,
       enabling use of date based sha1 expressions such as "&lt;branchname&gt;@{yesterday}". Note that in
       non-bare repositories, reflogs are usually enabled by default by the core.logallrefupdates config
       option.

   -f, --force
       Reset &lt;branchname&gt; to &lt;startpoint&gt; if &lt;branchname&gt; exists already. Without -fgit branch refuses to
       change an existing branch.

   -m, --move
       Move/rename a branch and the corresponding reflog.

   -M
       Move/rename a branch even if the new branch name already exists.

   --color[=&lt;when&gt;]
       Color branches to highlight current, local, and remote-tracking branches. The value must be always
       (the default), never, or auto.

   --no-color
       Turn off branch colors, even when the configuration file gives the default to color output. Same as
       --color=never.

   --column[=&lt;options&gt;], --no-column
       Display branch listing in columns. See configuration variable column.branch for option
       syntax.--column and --no-column without options are equivalent to always and never respectively.

       This option is only applicable in non-verbose mode.

   -r, --remotes
       List or delete (if used with -d) the remote-tracking branches.

   -a, --all
       List both remote-tracking branches and local branches.

   --list
       Activate the list mode.  git branch &lt;pattern&gt; would try to create a branch, use git branch --list
       &lt;pattern&gt; to list matching branches.

   -v, -vv, --verbose
       When in list mode, show sha1 and commit subject line for each head, along with relationship to
       upstream branch (if any). If given twice, print the name of the upstream branch, as well (see also
       git remote show &lt;remote&gt;).

   -q, --quiet
       Be more quiet when creating or deleting a branch, suppressing non-error messages.

   --abbrev=&lt;length&gt;
       Alter the sha1's minimum display length in the output listing. The default value is 7 and can be
       overridden by the core.abbrev config option.

   --no-abbrev
       Display the full sha1s in the output listing rather than abbreviating them.

   -t, --track
       When creating a new branch, set up branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote and branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge configuration
       entries to mark the start-point branch as "upstream" from the new branch. This configuration will
       tell git to show the relationship between the two branches in git status and git branch -v.
       Furthermore, it directs git pull without arguments to pull from the upstream when the new branch is
       checked out.

       This behavior is the default when the start point is a remote-tracking branch. Set the
       branch.autosetupmerge configuration variable to false if you want git checkout and git branch to
       always behave as if --no-track were given. Set it to always if you want this behavior when the
       start-point is either a local or remote-tracking branch.

   --no-track
       Do not set up "upstream" configuration, even if the branch.autosetupmerge configuration variable is
       true.

   --set-upstream
       If specified branch does not exist yet or if --force has been given, acts exactly like --track.
       Otherwise sets up configuration like --track would when creating the branch, except that where
       branch points to is not changed.

   -u &lt;upstream&gt;, --set-upstream-to=&lt;upstream&gt;
       Set up &lt;branchname&gt;'s tracking information so &lt;upstream&gt; is considered &lt;branchname&gt;'s upstream
       branch. If no &lt;branchname&gt; is specified, then it defaults to the current branch.

   --unset-upstream
       Remove the upstream information for &lt;branchname&gt;. If no branch is specified it defaults to the
       current branch.

   --edit-description
       Open an editor and edit the text to explain what the branch is for, to be used by various other
       commands (e.g.  request-pull).

   --contains [&lt;commit&gt;]
       Only list branches which contain the specified commit (HEAD if not specified). Implies --list.

   --merged [&lt;commit&gt;]
       Only list branches whose tips are reachable from the specified commit (HEAD if not specified).
       Implies --list.

   --no-merged [&lt;commit&gt;]
       Only list branches whose tips are not reachable from the specified commit (HEAD if not specified).
       Implies --list.

   &lt;branchname&gt;
       The name of the branch to create or delete. The new branch name must pass all checks defined by
       git-check-ref-format(1). Some of these checks may restrict the characters allowed in a branch name.

   &lt;start-point&gt;
       The new branch head will point to this commit. It may be given as a branch name, a commit-id, or a
       tag. If this option is omitted, the current HEAD will be used instead.

   &lt;oldbranch&gt;
       The name of an existing branch to rename.

   &lt;newbranch&gt;
       The new name for an existing branch. The same restrictions as for &lt;branchname&gt; apply.

        </pre>
        <p><b>DESCRIPTION</b></p>
        <p>
        Updates files in the working tree to match the version in the index or the specified tree. If no paths
        are given, git checkout will also update HEAD to set the specified branch as the current branch.
        </p>
        <p><b>OPTIONS</b></p>
        <pre>
   -q, --quiet
       Quiet, suppress feedback messages.

   -f, --force
       When switching branches, proceed even if the index or the working tree differs from HEAD. This is
       used to throw away local changes.

       When checking out paths from the index, do not fail upon unmerged entries; instead, unmerged
       entries are ignored.

   --ours, --theirs
       When checking out paths from the index, check out stage #2 (ours) or #3 (theirs) for unmerged
       paths.

   -b &lt;new_branch&gt;
       Create a new branch named &lt;new_branch&gt; and start it at &lt;start_point&gt;; see git-branch(1) for
       details.

   -B &lt;new_branch&gt;
       Creates the branch &lt;new_branch&gt; and start it at &lt;start_point&gt;; if it already exists, then reset it
       to &lt;start_point&gt;. This is equivalent to running "git branch" with "-f"; see git-branch(1) for
       details.

   -t, --track
       When creating a new branch, set up "upstream" configuration. See "--track" in git-branch(1) for
       details.

       If no -b option is given, the name of the new branch will be derived from the remote-tracking
       branch, by looking at the local part of the refspec configured for the corresponding remote, and
       then stripping the initial part up to the "*". This would tell us to use "hack" as the local branch
       when branching off of "origin/hack" (or "remotes/origin/hack", or even "refs/remotes/origin/hack").
       If the given name has no slash, or the above guessing results in an empty name, the guessing is
       aborted. You can explicitly give a name with -b in such a case.

   --no-track
       Do not set up "upstream" configuration, even if the branch.autosetupmerge configuration variable is
       true.

   -l
       Create the new branch's reflog; see git-branch(1) for details.

   --detach
       Rather than checking out a branch to work on it, check out a commit for inspection and discardable
       experiments. This is the default behavior of "git checkout &lt;commit&gt;" when &lt;commit&gt; is not a branch
       name. See the "DETACHED HEAD" section below for details.

   --orphan &lt;new_branch&gt;
       Create a new orphan branch, named &lt;new_branch&gt;, started from &lt;start_point&gt; and switch to it. The
       first commit made on this new branch will have no parents and it will be the root of a new history
       totally disconnected from all the other branches and commits.

       The index and the working tree are adjusted as if you had previously run "git checkout
       &lt;start_point&gt;". This allows you to start a new history that records a set of paths similar to
       &lt;start_point&gt; by easily running "git commit -a" to make the root commit.

       This can be useful when you want to publish the tree from a commit without exposing its full
       history. You might want to do this to publish an open source branch of a project whose current tree
       is "clean", but whose full history contains proprietary or otherwise encumbered bits of code.

       If you want to start a disconnected history that records a set of paths that is totally different
       from the one of &lt;start_point&gt;, then you should clear the index and the working tree right after
       creating the orphan branch by running "git rm -rf ." from the top level of the working tree.
       Afterwards you will be ready to prepare your new files, repopulating the working tree, by copying
       them from elsewhere, extracting a tarball, etc.

   --ignore-skip-worktree-bits
       In sparse checkout mode, git checkout -- &lt;paths&gt; would update only entries matched by &lt;paths&gt; and
       sparse patterns in $GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout. This option ignores the sparse patterns and adds
       back any files in &lt;paths&gt;.

   -m, --merge
       When switching branches, if you have local modifications to one or more files that are different
       between the current branch and the branch to which you are switching, the command refuses to switch
       branches in order to preserve your modifications in context. However, with this option, a three-way
       merge between the current branch, your working tree contents, and the new branch is done, and you
       will be on the new branch.

       When a merge conflict happens, the index entries for conflicting paths are left unmerged, and you
       need to resolve the conflicts and mark the resolved paths with git add (or git rm if the merge
       should result in deletion of the path).

       When checking out paths from the index, this option lets you recreate the conflicted merge in the
       specified paths.

   --conflict=&lt;style&gt;
       The same as --merge option above, but changes the way the conflicting hunks are presented,
       overriding the merge.conflictstyle configuration variable. Possible values are "merge" (default)
       and "diff3" (in addition to what is shown by "merge" style, shows the original contents).

   -p, --patch
       Interactively select hunks in the difference between the &lt;tree-ish&gt; (or the index, if unspecified)
       and the working tree. The chosen hunks are then applied in reverse to the working tree (and if a
       &lt;tree-ish&gt; was specified, the index).

       This means that you can use git checkout -p to selectively discard edits from your current working
       tree. See the "Interactive Mode" section of git-add(1) to learn how to operate the --patch mode.

   &lt;branch&gt;
       Branch to checkout; if it refers to a branch (i.e., a name that, when prepended with "refs/heads/",
       is a valid ref), then that branch is checked out. Otherwise, if it refers to a valid commit, your
       HEAD becomes "detached" and you are no longer on any branch (see below for details).

       As a special case, the "@{-N}" syntax for the N-th last branch/commit checks out branches (instead
       of detaching). You may also specify - which is synonymous with "@{-1}".

       As a further special case, you may use "A...B" as a shortcut for the merge base of A and B if there
       is exactly one merge base. You can leave out at most one of A and B, in which case it defaults to
       HEAD.

   &lt;new_branch&gt;
       Name for the new branch.

   &lt;start_point&gt;
       The name of a commit at which to start the new branch; see git-branch(1) for details. Defaults to
       HEAD.

   &lt;tree-ish&gt;
       Tree to checkout from (when paths are given). If not specified, the index will be used.

git merge [-n] [--stat] [--no-commit] [--squash] [--[no-]edit]
          [-s &lt;strategy&gt;] [-X &lt;strategy-option&gt;] [-S[&lt;key-id&gt;]]

git merge &lt;msg&gt; HEAD &lt;commit&gt;...
git merge --abort
        </pre>
        <p><b>DESCRIPTION</b></p>
        <p>
        Incorporates changes from the named commits (since the time their histories diverged from the current
        branch) into the current branch. This command is used by git pull to incorporate changes from another
        repository and can be used by hand to merge changes from one branch into another.
        <br><br>
        The second syntax (&lt;msg&gt; HEAD &lt;commit&gt;...) is supported for historical reasons. Do not use it from the
        command line or in new scripts. It is the same as git merge -m &lt;msg&gt; &lt;commit&gt;....
        <br><br>
        The third syntax ("git merge --abort") can only be run after the merge has resulted in conflicts. git
        merge --abort will abort the merge process and try to reconstruct the pre-merge state. However, if
        there were uncommitted changes when the merge started (and especially if those changes were further
        modified after the merge was started), git merge --abort will in some cases be unable to reconstruct
        the original (pre-merge) changes. Therefore:
        <br><br>
        Warning: Running git merge with non-trivial uncommitted changes is discouraged: while possible, it may
        leave you in a state that is hard to back out of in the case of a conflict.
        </p>
        <p><b>OPTIONS</b></p>
        <pre>
   --commit, --no-commit
       Perform the merge and commit the result. This option can be used to override --no-commit.

       With --no-commit perform the merge but pretend the merge failed and do not autocommit, to give the
       user a chance to inspect and further tweak the merge result before committing.

   --edit, -e, --no-edit
       Invoke an editor before committing successful mechanical merge to further edit the auto-generated
       merge message, so that the user can explain and justify the merge. The --no-edit option can be used
       to accept the auto-generated message (this is generally discouraged). The --edit (or -e) option is
       still useful if you are giving a draft message with the -m option from the command line and want to
       edit it in the editor.

       Older scripts may depend on the historical behaviour of not allowing the user to edit the merge log
       message. They will see an editor opened when they run git merge. To make it easier to adjust such
       scripts to the updated behaviour, the environment variable GIT_MERGE_AUTOEDIT can be set to no at
       the beginning of them.

   --ff
       When the merge resolves as a fast-forward, only update the branch pointer, without creating a merge
       commit. This is the default behavior.

   --no-ff
       Create a merge commit even when the merge resolves as a fast-forward. This is the default behaviour
       when merging an annotated (and possibly signed) tag.

   --ff-only
       Refuse to merge and exit with a non-zero status unless the current HEAD is already up-to-date or
       the merge can be resolved as a fast-forward.

   --log[=&lt;n&gt;], --no-log
       In addition to branch names, populate the log message with one-line descriptions from at most &lt;n&gt;
       actual commits that are being merged. See also git-fmt-merge-msg(1).

       With --no-log do not list one-line descriptions from the actual commits being merged.

   --stat, -n, --no-stat
       Show a diffstat at the end of the merge. The diffstat is also controlled by the configuration
       option merge.stat.

       With -n or --no-stat do not show a diffstat at the end of the merge.

   --squash, --no-squash
       Produce the working tree and index state as if a real merge happened (except for the merge
       information), but do not actually make a commit, move the HEAD, or record $GIT_DIR/MERGE_HEAD (to
       cause the next git commit command to create a merge commit). This allows you to create a single
       commit on top of the current branch whose effect is the same as merging another branch (or more in
       case of an octopus).

       With --no-squash perform the merge and commit the result. This option can be used to override
       --squash.

   -s &lt;strategy&gt;, --strategy=&lt;strategy&gt;
       Use the given merge strategy; can be supplied more than once to specify them in the order they
       should be tried. If there is no -s option, a built-in list of strategies is used instead (git
       merge-recursive when merging a single head, git merge-octopus otherwise).

   -X &lt;option&gt;, --strategy-option=&lt;option&gt;
       Pass merge strategy specific option through to the merge strategy.

   --verify-signatures, --no-verify-signatures
       Verify that the commits being merged have good and trusted GPG signatures and abort the merge in
       case they do not.

   --summary, --no-summary
       Synonyms to --stat and --no-stat; these are deprecated and will be removed in the future.

   -q, --quiet
       Operate quietly. Implies --no-progress.

   -v, --verbose
       Be verbose.

   --progress, --no-progress
       Turn progress on/off explicitly. If neither is specified, progress is shown if standard error is
       connected to a terminal. Note that not all merge strategies may support progress reporting.

   -S[&lt;keyid&gt;], --gpg-sign[=&lt;keyid&gt;]
       GPG-sign the resulting merge commit.

   -m &lt;msg&gt;
       Set the commit message to be used for the merge commit (in case one is created).

       If --log is specified, a shortlog of the commits being merged will be appended to the specified
       message.

       The git fmt-merge-msg command can be used to give a good default for automated git merge
       invocations.

   --[no-]rerere-autoupdate
       Allow the rerere mechanism to update the index with the result of auto-conflict resolution if
       possible.

   --abort
       Abort the current conflict resolution process, and try to reconstruct the pre-merge state.

       If there were uncommitted worktree changes present when the merge started, git merge --abort will
       in some cases be unable to reconstruct these changes. It is therefore recommended to always commit
       or stash your changes before running git merge.

       git merge --abort is equivalent to git reset --merge when MERGE_HEAD is present.

   &lt;commit&gt;...
       Commits, usually other branch heads, to merge into our branch. Specifying more than one commit will
       create a merge with more than two parents (affectionately called an Octopus merge).

       If no commit is given from the command line, merge the remote-tracking branches that the current
       branch is configured to use as its upstream. See also the configuration section of this manual
       page.
